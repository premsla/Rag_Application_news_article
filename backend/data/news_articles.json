    "text": "'The bombing has been insane': Palestinians scramble to flee Israeli assault on Gaza City\n\nRushdi AbualoufGaza correspondent, IstanbulAnadolu via Getty ImagesThousands of families are attempting to flee Gaza City as the Israeli military confirms it has begun ground operations that are part of its large-scale assault aimed at occupying the city. Lina al-Maghrebi, 32, a mother of three from the city's Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood told the BBC she had resisted leaving her home - despite the danger - until she received a phone call from an Israeli officer ordering her to evacuate. \"I was forced to sell my jewellery to cover the cost of displacement and a tent,\" she said. \"It took us 10 hours to reach Khan Younis, and we paid 3,500 shekels (£735) for the ride. The line of cars and trucks seemed endless.\"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a \"powerful operation\" had been launched in Gaza City, which he described as Hamas's last major stronghold.The Israeli military has designated al-Rashid coastal road as the only permitted route for civilians to use to evacuate. Many have described severe congestion, endless queues of cars and trucks, and long delays, with families stranded on the roadside while airstrikes continue overhead.The operation has drawn widespread international condemnation, including from the UN human rights chief and German foreign minister. UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper called the offensive \"utterly reckless and appalling\", saying it would \"only bring more bloodshed, kill more innocent civilians and endanger the remaining hostages\".But US Secretary of State Marco Rubio appeared to offer tacit support for Israel's operation during a joint press conference with Netanyahu on Monday, saying the US preferred a negotiated end to the war, but that \"sometimes when you're dealing with a group of savages like Hamas, that's not possible\".Israel's ramped up offensive comes as a United Nations commission of inquiry released a report on Tuesday that says Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel categorically rejected the report.Anadolu via Getty ImagesHundreds of thousands of people have fled Gaza City in recent weeksNivin Imad al-Din, 38, a mother of five, said she fled south after Israeli warplanes dropped evacuation leaflets in her neighbourhood, though her husband refused to leave their home.\"I couldn't take my furniture with me because I couldn't afford the cost of a large truck,\" she explained. \"Leaving everything behind was the hardest decision I've ever made.\"The cost of displacement has surged far beyond the reach of most households. Residents said renting a small truck now costs around 3,000 shekels (£630), while a tent for five people sells for about 4,000 shekels (£840). With most families deprived of income since the war began, some are forced to walk for miles or remain in their homes despite the risks.Overnight into Tuesday, Israeli warplanes carried out a wave of heavy airstrikes across Gaza City, with concentrated bombardment on the central al-Daraj neighbourhood, the Beach refugee camp in the west, and Sheikh Radwan in the north.The attacks were accompanied by artillery fire, drone fire and helicopter gunship activity. The Israel Defense Forces said it was \"gradually\" moving into Gaza City as part of the \"next phase\" of its offensive.It said air and ground forces would be part of this next stage of the military's operation, with the number of troops increasing day-by-day.Residents described the overnight strikes as \"hell\". Ghazi al-Aloul, a displaced resident from northern Gaza, told the BBC he is now sleeping at the entrance of al-Quds Hospital in Tel al-Hawa, southwest Gaza. \"I did not choose this,\" he said. \"I was forced after leaving the home where my family and I had been sheltering for nearly a month after fleeing the north\".\"The bombardment has been insane for hours, and the army is threatening to demolish several residential buildings in the area.\" Anadolu via Getty ImagesIn the past few days, some have been forced to flee down the coastal road at nightSami Abu Dalal, from al-Daraj in central Gaza, described the night as \"extremely difficult\".\"Whole residential blocks were levelled on top of their inhabitants, leaving many dead, missing, or injured,\" he said.He said Israel was advancing on three fronts - and was accompanied by the use of booby-trapped vehicles, intense airstrikes, and heavy shelling. Meanwhile, Apache helicopters hovered over different parts of the city, firing continuously.",

    "text": "Jeremy Bowen: UN genocide report a blunt indictment of Israel's actions in Gaza\n\nJeremy BowenInternational editorReutersA Palestinian woman inspects the damage at the site of Israeli strikes in Gaza City on 15 SeptemberThe report is intended to be detailed and damning, presenting evidence it says shows that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. It says that Israel has breached the Genocide Convention that was passed in 1948 by the newly established United Nations. The word genocide, and the convention that defined it as a crime, were directly inspired by the genocide of six million Jews by Nazi Germany.Israel denies all allegations that its conduct in Gaza has broken the treaties and conventions that make up the laws of war and international humanitarian law. It justifies its actions as self-defence, in protection of its citizens and to force the release of the hostages taken by Hamas and Islamic Jihad on 7 October 2023, around 20 of whom are believed still to be alive.The Israelis have dismissed the report as antisemitic lies inspired by Hamas. It was compiled by a commission of inquiry set up by the UN Human Rights Council. Israel and the US are boycotting the Council, which both countries say is biased against them.But the findings of the report will feed into the growing international condemnation of Israel's conduct, which is also coming from Israel's traditional western allies as well as the Gulf Arab monarchies that normalised relations with Israel in the Abraham Accords.Live coverage of this story'The bombing has been insane': Gaza City Palestinians scramble to fleeAFP via Getty ImagesIsrael's military campaign - which has involved heavy air strikes and the controlled demolition of buildings and infrastructure - has left much of Gaza in ruinsNext week at the UN General Assembly in New York, the United Kingdom, France, Australia, Canada and others are due to join the majority of UN members by recognising the sovereignty of an independent Palestinian state.The move will be more than symbolic. It will change the debate about the future of the conflict that began more than a century ago when Zionist Jews from Europe came to settle in Palestine. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, has condemned recognition as antisemitic, and a reward for Hamas terrorism.He says the Palestinians will never have independence in any part of the land between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea, as a Palestinian state would put Israelis in danger. Israeli religious nationalists believe the land was granted to the Jewish people alone by God.Genocide is defined in the 1948 convention, as the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group – in this case, Palestinians in Gaza.AFP via Getty ImagesMultiple UN agencies have said a \"man-made famine\" is ongoing in parts of GazaThe report details actions against Palestinians inside Gaza and in jails inside Israel.Among a long list of accusations is Israeli targeting of civilians that it has a legal obligation to protect, and the imposition of \"inhumane conditions causing the death of Palestinians, including the deprivation of food, water and medicines\". That is a reference to the blockade that has produced a famine as well as widespread starvation, according to the IPC, the international body that assesses food emergencies.The new UN report also details forced displacement, currently happening in Gaza City after the Israeli military, the IDF, ordered all civilians there to move south. Around one million people are believed to be affected. Israel's offensive is gathering pace, with air strikes and the destruction of many buildings, including high rises that are symbols of Gaza City, which the IDF calls Hamas \"terror towers\". The report also says that Israel has imposed \"measures intended to prevent births\". That refers to an attack on Gaza's largest fertility clinic that reportedly destroyed around 4000 embryos and 1000 sperm samples and unfertilised eggs.As well as the results of military action, the UN report singles out three Israeli officials for inciting genocide.AFP via Getty ImagesPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left), President Isaac Herzog (centre), and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant (second from right), are accused of inciting genocideThey are Yoav Gallant, then the defence minister, who said on 9 October 2023 that Israel was fighting \"human animals\". Like Prime Minister Netanyahu, Gallant already faces an arrest warrant for war crimes from the International Criminal Court.Netanyahu is also accused of incitement by comparing the Gaza war to the story of the Jewish fight against an enemy known as Amalek. In the bible God tells the Jewish people to eliminate all the Amalek men, women and children, as well as their possessions and their animals.The third official singled out is President Isaac Herzog, who in the first week of the war condemned Gaza's Palestinians for not rising up against Hamas. He said on 13 October 2023 that \"it's an entire nation out there that is responsible\".Legally, it is hard to prove the crime of genocide. The people who framed the Genocide Convention, and interpretations made by the ICJ in more recent cases deliberately set a high legal bar.At the International Court of Justice in The Hague, South Africa has brought a case that Israel has committed genocide against the Palestinians. It will take several years for the case to be adjudicated.But with the war in Gaza continuing and perhaps escalating further with the current Israeli offensive, the UN report is going to deepen international divisions about the war.On one side are countries who demand an immediate end to the killing and destruction in Gaza, and condemn the famine caused by Israel's siege. They include the UK and France.On the other are Israel, and the United States. The administration of President Donald Trump continues to provide vital military aid and diplomatic cover without which the Israelis would struggle to continue the war in Gaza and its bombing campaigns elsewhere in the Middle East.",

    "text": "Keir Starmer orders investigation into MI5 over false evidence\n\nDaniel De SimoneInvestigations correspondent The prime minister has ordered a new investigation into how MI5 gave false evidence to three courts about conversations with the BBC.Sir Keir Starmer's direction follows requests from the High Court and Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT), which both rejected MI5's explanations about what happened.The case centres on a neo-Nazi state informant known as Agent X who used his MI5 role to coerce his girlfriend, whom he attacked with a machete.On Tuesday, the prime minister wrote to the Investigatory Powers Commissioner Sir Brian Leveson directing him to conduct a new inquiry.In a written statement to Parliament, Sir Keir said: \"I have now issued a direction to the Commissioner to commence this investigation immediately.\" He said the courts \"will use the outcome of this investigation to determine their next steps in relation to the case of Agent X\".Sir Keir noted that the relevant courts had found that MI5's investigations into the false evidence \"suffered from serious procedural deficiencies\".In a letter to Sir Brian, the prime minister said the courts had \"rightly expressed their displeasure at MI5 for providing this false evidence\".The investigation will be led by the Deputy Investigatory Powers Commissioner, Sir John Goldring, who will be supported by a \"small investigation team\". Sir John oversaw the Hillsborough inquests a decade ago.In February, the BBC revealed that MI5 had lied to three courts while defending its handling of the misogynistic MI5 agent, whom the BBC had sought to expose in a 2022 investigation.Arguing for secrecy, the Security Service told judges it had stuck to its policy of not confirming or denying informants' identities.In fact, MI5 had disclosed the Agent X's status in phone calls to me, as it tried to persuade me not to investigate him. The service aggressively maintained its position until I produced evidence proving it was untrue, including a recording of one of the calls.Following the BBC's revelations, MI5's Director General Sir Ken McCallum apologised. Two official inquiries then took place which absolved MI5 and its officers of deliberate wrongdoing, claiming the false evidence was down to mistakes and poor memories.But, in July, a panel of senior high court judges ruled that the \"investigations carried out by MI5 to date suffer from serious procedural deficiencies\" and that \"we cannot rely on their conclusions\". They said it would be \"premature\" to decide whether to begin contempt of court proceedings against any MI5 officers before a new investigation took place.Later the same month, the IPT also rejected MI5's explanations and requested a new investigation.The tribunal also said its concerns were not confined only to the possibility of contempt of court but to wider questions of whether the duty of candour was fully complied with by MI5 and the government, and whether it is possible to identify individuals who were responsible for that failure, potentially including government lawyers. The duty of candour requires public bodies to be open and honest in disclosing relevant information in legal proceedings.In a statement today, Sir Brian Leveson said: \"I have received Sir Ken McCallum's assurance that the inspection team will have access to legally privileged material where this is required.\"The new investigation's terms of reference say it should consider the circumstances resulting in the \"provision of false evidence to both the High Court and to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, including the degree of compliance with the duty of candour, in proceedings connected with Agent X.\"A Home Office spokesperson said: \"The Home Secretary is concerned that inaccurate evidence was provided to the High Court and Investigatory Powers Tribunal. The Director General of MI5 has rightly apologised for this serious failing, both publicly and to the Courts.\"",

    "text": "Southport Inquiry: Teacher's fears over killer met with 'red tape'\n\nGetty ImagesThe Southport Inquiry will examine whether any agencies \"took responsibility\" for managing his caseA teacher emailed her colleague in frustration at the \"frightening red tape\" preventing her from getting police, social services and mental health interventions for the Southport killer, a public inquiry heard. Violence-obsessed Axel Rudakubana had assaulted other children, attacked his own father and been caught carrying knives between 2019 and July 2024, when he murdered three girls at a dance studio.But different agencies - including Prevent, MI5 and social services - appeared to pass his case between them, the inquiry heard.Nicholas Moss KC, lead counsel to Southport Inquiry, said it would focus in the coming months on whether any agencies involved had \"taken responsibility\". He said it was \"notable\" that the then 17-year-old appeared to have deliberately targeted women and girls when he chose to attack the Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop.Nine-year-old Alice Aguiar, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Bebe King, six, were killed and eight other children and two adults were seriously wounded. The inquiry, sitting at Liverpool Town Hall, had been set up to explore the killer's history, his contact with relevant agencies and any \"missed opportunities\" to prevent the \"manifestly and extremely cowardly\" attack. Family handoutsBebe King, Elsie Dot Stancombe and Alice Aguiar were murdered in the attack on 29 July 2024Delivering his opening statement, Mr Moss said the \"red tape\" email was sent by Cheryl Smith, a safeguarding lead at Presfield High School in Southport, who had been trying to get the teenager to attend school for around a year.Mr Moss said the school's efforts \"came to a head\" on 21 March 2023 when Ms Smith wrote to a colleague describing how she had contacted social services, child mental health teams and the police to try and get them to intervene - all in vain. She added: \"Short of breaking in I don't know how to see this kid.\"Mr Moss said the first phase of the inquiry would focus on three \"central themes\" - whether agencies \"took responsibility or ownership\" for his case, whether anyone was looking at the \"overall picture\" of his risk, and what \"fundamental change\" may be necessary to make the system work. Mr Moss said the killer's internet use and purchase of weapons - including machetes and archery equipment - would also be significant. The inquiry has heard on the morning of the attack the teenager searched the social media platform X for \"Mar Mari Emmanuel stabbing\"- which brought up a graphic video showing Bishop Emmanuel being attacked in a church in Sydney, Australia. Mr Moss said although most of his search history had been deleted, detectives found he had very recently viewed a PDF file called \"excerpt from Kamikaze death poetry\". One tablet recovered from his house included downloads of material including documents about genocide, torture and weapons, an image of Hitler and a picture of a wolf in a suit with the caption: \"Just be a lone wolf bro\". One document, which formed part of a terrorism charge Rudakubana admitted, was a study of an Al-Qaeda Training Manual - although police also found \"anti-Islamic\" material. On another device police found screenshots of \"very disturbing\" images including graphic injuries, slavery, mistreatment of women and Nazi Germany. 'No terrorist ideology'The inquiry heard his behaviour at school began to \"deteriorate rapidly\" from the start of Year 9, when he was 13. Teachers at the Range High School in Formby had reported incidents including hitting other children, and commenting \"that's why teachers get murdered\" when he was given a detention. He was expelled from mainstream education in October 2019 after admitting he had taken a knife to school because he \"wanted to kill a bully\". In the December, he went back to the school and attacked a pupil with a hockey stick while carrying a knife in his backpack. This resulted in him pleading guilty to assault and carrying an offensive weapon. Between 2019 and 2021, he was referred to the government's counter-extremism service Prevent three times by teachers concerned at comments he had made, and internet searches for topics including \"school shootings\" and terror attacks.But on each occasion, including after a multi-agency meeting with MI5, the referrals were closed by counter terrorism officers because no \"terrorist or domestic extremist ideology\" was identified.Mr Moss said during that time, various teams within Lancashire County Council's social services department opened and closed cases with him. PA MediaFlowers were laid outside Southport Town Hall in the aftermath of the killingsMr Moss said the killer's father, Alphonse, asked for support from social workers and mental health services when his behaviour became increasingly unmanageable. On different occasions ahead of the attack, the teenager kicked his father, poured milk over him and threatened him with a knife, the inquiry heard. Mr Moss also said the inquiry would also address the behaviour of certain individuals, including taxi driver Gary Poland, who dropped the killer off at the dance studio. Dashcam footage showed Mr Poland saw the teenager enter the building at 11:45 BST. Children began to run out screaming a few seconds later. But Mr Poland, who will give evidence at a later date, drove away from the scene and collected another fare before eventually calling the police at 12:46. The inquiry heard he told the police he was \"sorry\" and had acted out of \"complete shock\". Alphonse Rudakubana had also disclosed to police that he found a bow and arrow in his son's bedroom around a week before the attack, and had signed for deliveries of machetes his son had ordered online. Mr Moss said the killer's family would be questioned on what items they may have found around the house and what \"steps\" they took to try and recover knives. He told the inquiry this was \"particularly important\" because on 22 July 2024, a week before the attack, Mr Rudakubana had stopped his son getting into a taxi to Range High School with a rucksack on, which he suspected contained a knife. Earlier, Sir Adrian Fulford, chairman of the inquiry, promised to do everything \"humanly possible\" to answer the questions of bereaved families and victims.The inquiry continues.

And how do we make sure this sort of thing does not happen again because something went very wrong.\"When Lord Mandelson was appointed, red flags were obviously missed or ignored.\"The debate comes ahead of a state visit to the UK by US President Donald Trump, who is expected to arrive in the country on Tuesday evening.",

    "text": "Judge dismisses terrorism charges against Luigi Mangione\n\nMike Wendling andPratiksha GhildialManhattan Supreme CourtLuigi Mangione led into courtroomA judge in New York state has dismissed two terrorism charges against Luigi Mangione, the alleged killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.However, Judge Gregory Carro during a hearing on Tuesday morning ruled a charge of second-degree murder against Mangione could stand.He said prosecutors had failed to establish that there was enough evidence to justify the terrorism-related murder charges that they sought against Mangione. Mangione is accused of gunning down Thompson on a busy Manhattan street in December last year.In a written ruling, Carro said that the allegations against Mangione did not meet the definition of terrorism under state law. Although prosecutors argued that writings left by Mangione demonstrated a terrorism motive, the judge said they failed to show that the suspect intended to put political pressure on the government or terrorise the general population - key provisions of New York's terrorism law which was passed in the wake of the 11 September 2001 attacks. \"There was no evidence presented that the defendant made any demands of government or sought any particular governmental policy change, let alone that he did so by intimidation or coercion,\" Carro wrote in his ruling. The first-degree murder charge that was dismissed would have carried a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.If convicted of the remaining second-degree murder charge, Mangione faces a minimum sentence of 15 to 25 years in prison. He has also been charged with weapons and forgery crimes.And in addition to the New York state criminal proceedings, Mangione also faces federal murder charges, which could lead to the death penalty.Carro rejected the defence team's request to delay the state trial until the conclusion of Mangione's federal trial. During the hearing on Tuesday the judge ruled that trial hearings would begin on 1 December.Mangione has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.Thompson, a father of two, was the chief executive of the insurance division of  UnitedHealth Group - the largest health insurer in the US.He was in New York City for a meeting when he was shot three times on a busy Manhattan street at around 6:45 a.m. on 4 December.After a five-day manhunt, Mangione was arrested about 300 miles (480km) away, at a McDonald's restaurant in Altoona, Pennsylvania.Police said he left a note criticising companies profiting from the US health care system, accusing them of \"corruption and greed\".Outside the Manhattan Supreme Court on Tuesday a handful of Mangione's supporters gathered, some of them holding placards with slogans such as \"Free Luigi\" and \"Innocent until proven guilty\".

    "text": "World Athletics Championships: Faith Kipyegon storms to historic fourth 1500m title in Tokyo\n\nMedia caption, Kipyegon defends World Championship title to take gold for KenyaFaith Kipyegon stormed to a historic fourth world 1500m title as the Kenyan great extended her streak of dominance with a fifth consecutive global gold in the event.The 31-year-old matched retired men's world record holder Hicham El Guerrouj as the only other athlete in history to amass four 1500m titles at the championships.After securing her third consecutive Olympic triumph last year, this was also a third straight world gold for Kipyegon, who controlled the final from the start before bursting clear of her rivals on the final lap.Not only is the world record holder unbeaten in the past five global finals but, excluding heats, she has not suffered defeat over the distance for more than four years.Australia's Olympic silver medallist Jessica Hull faded to bronze after attempting to follow as Kipyegon wound up the pace, with Dorcus Ewoi securing a Kenyan one-two.The unstoppable Kipyegon crossed the line in three minutes 52.15 seconds, the chasm separating her from her competitors evidenced by the near three-second wait for Ewoi to follow.\"I just want to thank God,\" Kipyegon told BBC Sport.\"I knew I was capable of defending my world title after breaking the world record [earlier this year]. I thank God that I was strong today.\"I just wanted to run comfortable without pushes and falls, because I was a little bit scared seeing people falling. I just wanted to be by myself and run my race.\"'There's nothing anyone can do to stop her'With outstretched arms and a relaxed smile which suggested it had never felt in doubt, Kipyegon celebrated the eighth global gold of her career.That is level with Jamaican sprint star Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce - the only other woman to win as many as four world titles in the same event - and distance running great Tirunesh Dibaba for the most by a female athlete in individual events.Kipyegon will now target a second successive world double in the 5,000m, the heats for which begin on Thursday before Saturday's final.She became the first woman to achieve that world 1500m-5,000m double two years ago.The competition in the women's 1500m is fierce, and was a factor in Great Britain's Olympic 1500m bronze medallist Georgia Hunter Bell's decision to prioritise the 800m in Japan.Yet it has been a long time since the destination of the gold medal was in doubt.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Faith Kipyegon has won eight global golds on the trackKipyegon has swept seven of the past eight global titles, with Sifan Hassan the last athlete to deny her at the 2019 World Championships in Doha.Keen to continue pushing the boundaries - and, as a mother, inspire young girls and women in particular - she made an ambitious bid to become the first woman in history to run a sub-four-minute mile in June.Although she came up short, she still ran 1.22 seconds faster than her personal best of 4:07.64 - the time which remains the official mile world record, and still five seconds faster than any other woman has run in history.Long before she was pursuing history in the latest high-tech shoes, Kipyegon would run barefoot to and from school in her village as a child. She even won her first global cross country title with nothing on her feet.The oldest woman to ever win a world 1500m title, she continues to go from strength to strength.Kipyegon began the year by just missing the world 1000m record in April, improved her 1500m world record to 3:48.68 in July, and was within a second of breaking the 3,000m record - which has stood for 32 years - in her final race before Tokyo.One night after Armand Duplantis soared to a 14th world record and third world title at Japan's National Stadium, this too appears a reign of dominance unlikely to end any time soon.Commentating on BBC TV, Andrew Cotter said: \"I like the way she goes about this type of race. She can do a 58 last lap, the others can't. \"She makes the third lap quicker than the second, the second quicker than the first. \"It just means that there is nothing anyone else can do but survive, hang on.\"More on this story",

    "text": "Why Trump's UK state visit is mired with potential pitfalls\n\nTrump's state visit is mired with potential pitfalls despite careful planningJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondentBBCListen to James read this article US President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom this week will be no stranger to controversy, just as his first was six years ago.Back then, in June 2019, as well as taking tea with the late Queen, the US President called London Mayor Sadiq Khan \"a stone-cold loser\", backed Boris Johnson in a Tory leadership race and suggested the NHS should be part of US-UK trade talks.All this was accompanied by a petition saying he should not receive a state visit in the UK, signed by more than one million people, as well as noisy protests involving thousands and a huge inflatable effigy that became known as the Trump Baby.This week's second state visit – unprecedented for a non-royal - will prove the first was no exception. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty ImagesTrump being invited for a second state visit is unprecedented for a non-royal (pictured above during his previous visit, with First Lady Melania, in 2019)There will again be protests and Lord Mandelson's sacking as UK ambassador to the US has already cast a diplomatic pall over proceedings.Planning for the visit - over Wednesday and Thursday - has gone on for months, but for all the careful preparation, the possibility that things could go wrong is still very real. And for many of those organising it, the Mandelson affair is only one of their worries.How Windsor became 'Trumpton'For those at the royal end of the show, the focus has been on logistics and security - and turning Windsor Castle into a ring of steel hard enough to satisfy even the most fastidious secret service agents.Such has been the huge American presence some locals have renamed Windsor \"Trumpton\", after the eponymous town in the 1970s children's TV show.Mark Kerrison/In Pictures via Getty ImagesDetailed planning for the visit has gone on for months, down to banquet menus, seating plans and wording of the King's seven-minute speechFor Palace officials, attention to detail is all.One of the biggest problems has been finding a place to muster the Household Cavalry.It needs to be far enough from the helicopter landing zones to ensure the horses are not spooked by the noise, close enough to form the escort quickly that will accompany the Trumps' carriage procession through the grounds of Windsor Castle.There has also been much discussion between the Palace and Foreign Office over who sits where at the State Banquet in St George's Hall.\"The value of these things are not just the photo opportunities but also all the off-grid conversations,\" said one royal insider. \"A huge amount of attention goes into the seating plan for the banquet. So people with certain policy areas are sat next to one another.\"Jonathan Brady - WPA Pool/Getty ImagesOne challenge has been making sure that the helicopter landing zones are positioned to ensure the horses of the Mounted Household Cavalry (pictured) are not spooked by the noise Much thought, too, is devoted to the menu and the music which will involve \"lots of nods to his Scottish heritage\".King Charles III's seven-minute speech at the banquet has gone through many drafts, ensuring he pushes the right buttons without crossing political lines.Officials say they have been given no indication by their US counterparts of what Trump may say in his speech.'Pressure to make this massive'So far, so logistical – but the key challenge for royal organisers has been finding a way of ensuring Trump feels he has been given a full state visit with all the trimmings. That is no easy task.The president is on the ground for less than 48 hours and will not visit Downing Street, address Parliament or even find time to play a round of golf.\"There has been a large amount of government pressure to make this massive and that's been the challenge,\" one courtier told me.Jeff Gilbert - WPA Pool/Getty ImagesPresident Trump (pictured on his first state visit to the UK) will return for a second state visit this Wednesday and ThursdayThe scale of the ceremonial at Windsor has been stepped up, with 1,300 troops and 120 horses involved - far more than those used when President Macron of France visited earlier this year. (It's a point that will no doubt be emphasised to the Americans in private.)For the ceremonial hoopla is the overwhelming focus of the White House in this visit; a chance for the President to be photographed with the King and Queen and the Prince and Princess of Wales, along with military parades and bands and the Red Arrows.One Whitehall source said: \"The focus is very much on the optics, the historic moment, the pomp. For Trump it's all about TV and this is great TV.\"Another said: \"It's theatre. It's all show. It's not like we are going to do deep substance. We are sucking up to the most powerful guy in the world for good reason.\"Peter Nicholls/Getty ImagesMembers of the Guard of Honour rehearse the ceremonial welcome The Trumps: Warm and solicitous guestsLord McDonald, a former top civil servant in the Foreign Office, said the UK's strategic choice to afford the most powerful man in the world \"the fullest honour British protocol allows\" will be watched closely by the rest of the world.\"This state visit is not just a UK-US event,\" he said. \"It will be one of the biggest stories around the world. \"The rest of the world will be looking at London and Windsor, burnishing the UK's wider international standing.\"Many officials are confident the visit will go smoothly, simply because all sides want it to succeed.They emphasise that Palace staff thought the Trumps were warm and solicitous guests in 2019, both keen not to put a foot wrong. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty ImagesPresident Trump and King Charles will both make speeches at a banquet during the state visit\"Trump can be quite funny in private,\" said one diplomat. \"He has got quite a neat turn of phrase that the King will appreciate.\"For the UK government, the overwhelming aim is for Air Force One to take off on Thursday evening with Trump warmly disposed to Britain.Serious business behind the pageantryBeyond providing a day of royal pageantry, the government has business to conduct on Thursday when proceedings move to the prime minister's country residence at Chequers.Ministers hope to complete a deal to exclude UK steel and aluminium from US tariffs. There will be some new civil nuclear cooperation.The centrepiece is set to be the signing of a technology partnership, involving new investment in Britain and greater cooperation with Silicon Valley on artificial intelligence and quantum computing.This was Lord Mandelson's priority, something he described in his outgoing letter to embassy staff last week as \"my personal pride and joy\", that he claimed would \"help write the next chapter of the special relationship\".All these issues will be portrayed as big domestic \"wins\" to help promote the government's growth agenda.Carl Court - Pool/Getty ImagesMinisters hope to complete a deal to exclude UK steel and aluminium from US tariffsThe visit will also provide Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer with a significant opportunity to bend the ear of the president just a week before the United Nations general assembly in New York, especially on Ukraine.Jeremy Hunt, who as Foreign Secretary was heavily involved in the last Trump state visit, said this was a key chance to shape the president's thinking.\"Trump appears to be on a journey away from Putin, towards recognising that he needs a way of standing with his European allies a bit better,\" Hunt said.\"What the government will really be wanting to do is continue that journey, looking for a deal to impose more sanctions on countries buying Russian oil.\"Leon Neal/Getty ImagesPlanning has heavily focused on security - and turning Windsor Castle into a ring of steelSophia Gaston, senior research fellow at King's College London, said the state visit was an important chance for the UK to influence US policy at a crucial stage of the Trump administration, a window of opportunity between its disruptive first six months and next year when its focus may shift to domestic elections and strategic competition with China.\"We are moving into a new phase,\" she said. \"This state visit really does matter. It is about us securing a foothold as the primary symbolic and strategic ally of the United States.\"The Mandelson questionFor all these potential gains, the risks are huge and the most obvious involves, of course, Lord Mandelson.The peer's dismissal as ambassador, after revelations of the scale of his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein following Epstein's conviction as a paedophile, means the press conference at Chequers on Thursday will not be dominated by questions about his future.Instead, the prime minister will likely be asked why he appointed the peer in the first place and why he took so long to sack him; what did he know and when?Carl Court/Getty ImagesThe PM will likely be asked why he appointed Lord Mandelson and why he took so long to sack himSome diplomats wonder if Trump may voice an opinion about who should replace Lord Mandelson, potentially putting No 10 in an invidious position.But perhaps the most dangerous question for the Prime Minister may be why he thinks Lord Mandelson should be punished for his links to Epstein, but not the US President standing next to him.According to Whitehall sources, this was a point Lord Mandelson deployed as he fought to save his job. It was not an argument that found favour in No 10 and officials note Trump, unlike Lord Mandelson, cut ties with Epstein well before his conviction - but it is a question that will float above this week's royal and political ceremonial.Jim Watson/AFP via Getty ImagesLord Mandelson, who has been sacked as UK ambassador to the US, pictured with Trump and VanceDiplomats I have spoken to insist that so far the White House has been sanguine - if not a little bemused - at Lord Mandelson's departure, saying it is the UK's business, and the president remains excited about the state visit. But there is a fear among some that if Trump were dragged into the controversy and embarrassed at the press conference, then that could sour his mood – and the visit.Profound differences in the UK and USThe Mandelson affair is not the only potential challenge. As one distinguished former British ambassador told me: \"On values and policies, we have fundamental differences with the Trump administration – on Nato, Ukraine, Middle East and China.\"The differences are more profound than at any time since World War Two.\"Perhaps the most acute difference that could overshadow the visit relates to the Middle East.Next week the UK is expected to formally recognise Palestinian statehood in an attempt to keep alive the idea of a so-called \"two state solution\". But the Americans are strongly opposed, as the Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, made clear on Friday, emphasising his commitment \"to fight anti-Israel actions including unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state that rewards Hamas terrorism\".Getty ImagesProtests took place in the UK during Trump's last state visit, and there was a huge inflatable effigy that became known as the Trump BabyThere are also political risks for the prime minister. Underlying this state visit is an unspoken transaction: that it is worth giving Trump all those trimmings in order to help British interests, namely to reduce tariffs and foster investment partnerships.Yet Trump is unpopular in the UK. A YouGov poll in July found only 16% of Britons surveyed say they have a positive view of him. The government will have to explain to voters why it believes this state visit is a price worth paying to try to grow the British economy.The diplomatic game of cardsAmid these potential pitfalls lies a deeper, but less discussed risk from this state visit. That is: in its diplomatic game of cards, has the government played its King too explicitly for political purposes?\"The government have the convening power of the King and they have used it in a very transactional way, for example the brandishing of the King's letter in the Oval Office,\" said one royal source. \"They realise the Palace can draw people in, in a way that you can't in Whitehall. Peter Summers/Getty ImagesThere have only ever been three state visits by US presidents: President Bush in 2003; President Obama in 2011 and President Trump in 2019\"The problem in using the personality of the monarch and the institution of the monarchy is there is a risk that you cross a line and you ask someone who has to remain studiously non-political to transact a political act on behalf of the government.\"Official state visits by US presidents are rare. There have only ever been three: President Bush in 2003; President Obama in 2011 and Trump in 2019. All other visits were official or informal. So this week's does matter.But even if it passes off smoothly and gaffe-free questions may remain about its efficacy. \"This is very early in Trump's presidency,\" one diplomat said.\"Have we played this card too soon? What do we do for an encore?\"Top picture credits: Win McNamee/Getty Images, Neil Hall /EPA/Shutterstock and Hollie Adams, WPA Pool/Getty Images, Yuri Gripas/Abaca/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "text": "Sepsis leaves Cardiff medical student facing life with no limbs\n\nTriathlete ready to face life with no limbs after sepsis Lily, 24, shares how her flu-like symptoms led to two heart attacks and a three-month coma in hospitalA triathlete is ready to face life with no limbs after they were all amputated as she fought sepsis.Cardiff University medical student Lily McGarry, from Jersey, believed she was experiencing a bout of \"freshers' flu\".But after being taken to hospital, the 24-year-old suffered two heart attacks and fell into a coma, with the next three months a complete blank. The life-threatening condition, where the body's response to an infection damages tissues and organs is not yet clearly understood and can affect anyone, of any age, according to the UK Sepsis Trust. \"When you're young you think, as I did, that these kind of conditions don't affect you,\" said Lily. \"You feel a bit invincible, and you don't want to worry about your health because you've got a social life to live.\"Described by her friends as \"a fantastic sportswoman\", Lily was passionate about swimming, running and being at the beach. But as she lies in her bed at Cardiff's Llandough Hospital, she remembers the day her normal student lifestyle was turned upside down, and contemplates how she can return to an active lifestyle.\"I felt a bit under the weather, but I was still going about my daily life,\" she said. \"I was sat at home with my housemates at uni.\"Then I watched Gavin and Stacey all day sat on the sofa.\"This was on 14 January, and she decided to go to bed at about 23:00, adding: \"I just thought I'd have a rest and sleep it off.\"Family handoutLily took part in triathlons as part of a very active lifestyle, which included swimming and running regularly But as the night went on, Lily's condition deteriorated.She added: \"My housemate saw my light was still on when she got up in the night, and came to see me. \"I was sick everywhere and had been incontinent.\"Her friends Lucy and Ella cleaned her up and took her to A&E, at which point she noticed a rash that was starting to spread on her body. Lily was taken to the resuscitation area, and was still not fully aware of the seriousness of her condition, adding: \"I was able to walk into A&E and so at that point I thought I'd just receive some antibiotics and go home the next day. \"But in resus I remember the consultant asking for my mum and dad's mobile numbers.\"Apart from being in a room surrounded by doctors and nurses, she remembers very little after this, until about three months later in April. Lily did not even know she had suffered a cardiac arrest, and describes it as \"quite surreal\" finding out about this from a post her sister had written.\"I don't think I really realised the scale of what had happened until about May when I was starting to look at my body,\" she added. \"I've been told I quickly went into septic shock.\"My blood pressure was very low and within 24 hours I'd had two cardiac arrests and was diagnosed with meningococcal septicaemia.\"Lily is recovering at Llandough Hospital after sepsis completely changed her life What is sepsis?Sepsis occurs when the body responds improperly to infection, causing the organs to work poorly. It can cause a dramatic drop in blood pressure and damage the lungs, kidneys, liver and other organs.According to UK Sepsis Trust, one of the key challenges in identifying sepsis is that it can present very differently in each patient.There are six key symptoms to look out for:S - slurred speech or confusionE - extreme pain in muscles and jointsP - passing no urine in a dayS - severe breathlessnessI - people saying \"it feels like I'm going to die\"S - skin that's mottled, discoloured or very paleMegan McDonaghLily is positive about the future and is contemplating how she can get back to an active sporting life \"I'm fortunate to have lost my limbs in an age where there's lots of technology,\" Lily said. She is considering devices such as hand cycles, adding: \"I've always liked swimming and being in the water and I'm really excited about the sense of freedom I'll have without gravity in the water.\"So I hope that can happen soon.\"Lily will head back to Jersey in November, and is looking forward to seeing her grandparents, going to the beach and to \"recuperate and reflect on what's happened\".Ella JenningsElla Jennings (left) said her friend Lily McGarry (centre) was the most selfless person she had ever metFriends and family are also raising money to help give her as many opportunities as possible, and she describes feeling emotional about support from Wales, Jersey and further afield. Housemate Ella Jennings described how compassionate and caring she is, and how Lily would go out of her way to help others.\"Since she's got poorly she's just that and more, she's so positive,\" Ella added.\"Every time I see her she's making more progress and thinking about the future, she's so determined. She's still the same Lily asking about everyone else and caring about everyone else.\"Honestly she blows my mind, every time I see her, she astounds me with her attitude and her outlook on life.\"",

    "text": "How long can the UK afford the pension triple lock?\n\nDharshini DavidDeputy economics editor andRaphael SheridanEconomics reporterBBCGlenys is concerned about people whose only income is the basic state pensionAt a weekly ballet class in Wokingham, dancers glide elegantly through an intricate series of poses, making it look easy despite ranging in age from 50 to over 80.Figures released on Tuesday, suggesting retirees will likely benefit from a 4.7% increase in the state pension from next April, will add a spring to those dancers' steps.Yet concerns remain. Glenys worries about those whose only income is the basic state pension.\"I do feel sorry for people that are struggling, if it's food or heat,\" she says.Meanwhile, former architect Mary says her children's generation are having to strive harder and for longer to afford to start a family or buy a home. \"My daughter's about to give birth, and she's beginning to contribute to a pension. But what it's going to be like for the new grandchild, I've no idea.\"Glenys and Mary's reflections show not only the success of the triple lock system used to increase pensions but also raises questions around its fairness and its sustainability.What is the triple lock and how much is the state pension worth?The triple lock formula says that the state pension will rise in spring by the greater of 2.5%, the previous September's inflation rate, or the increase in average earnings registered over the previous summer.Because the earnings figure published on Tuesday morning is almost certain to be the highest of those three, it is likely the state pension will go up by 4.7% in April.The measure has helped to cut the number of pensioners living in poverty, but according to the minister who launched it, Sir Steve Webb, it's not job done yet. The UK's state pension is less generous than the average in rich countries, meaning we are more reliant on private savings. And the nature of the cost of living crisis of the past few years, centred on the staples like food and energy, has left those reliant on the state pension particularly stretched.It could get worse for some pensioners. The triple lock means the new state pension - for those who reached pension age after April 2016 - is creeping closer to the £12,570 threshold at which tax becomes payable.That threshold is set to be frozen until 2028, meaning people like former hairdresser Linda will soon likely end up paying income tax on their pension under current plans.\"You're given it in one hand and it's taken away in the other, so that's not a lot of good,\" she says.\"If they could raise the tax threshold, it would make a huge difference.\"The state pension faces other issues. We are living longer and having fewer children, so the bill is booming and it is being footed by a falling share of the population.Already, funding the state pension accounted for almost £140bn in the last financial year, making it the second biggest claim on the public purse after health spending. And the amount spent is vulnerable to the kind of extremes in inflation we've seen in recent years, meaning it now costs about three times as much as its architects originally reckoned.Linda worries about having to pay tax on her state pension in the futureFuture sums threaten to be eyewatering. The government's own independent forecaster says that by 2070 the amount needed to fund the state pension will be equivalent to 7.7% of GDP - 50% higher than right now. That is quite an ask of taxpayers when other claims on the public purse are also projected to soar, in particular healthcare spending - largely for the same group of older Brits.As the costs mount, many economists say the triple lock might disappear. Keeping it going means shifting an increasing amount of resources from younger generations, workers and business owners, to older ones.The government has committed to keeping it in place for the rest of the parliament, but Pensions Minister Torsten Bell admitted in a previous role - as chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, a think tank that focuses on the plight of the lower paid - that the triple lock is a \"messy tool\".So what should replace it? In his previous job, Bell touted a system of increases that was shielded from spikes in inflation. Webb, who acknowledges the triple lock can't continue \"infinitely\", has mentioned a system of getting the pension to a certain proportion of average earnings – and then maintaining that. Others have floated the idea of linking it to inflation or earnings increases.The question is whether politicians would do any of this. The scrutiny in the run-up to the last election on the triple lock, and the row over the winter fuel payment, underscores what a sensitive topic pensioners' finances are with voters.That is not just the case with current retirees. Shortly after speaking to Linda, Glenys and Mary, we visited a board game night in Reading where players were mainly in their 20s and 30s. They pointed out that pensioners can still find it a struggle to afford the basics and, crucially, they themselves know that this is the scheme that they will have to rely on in some form.Small wonder that most politicians shy away from the issue where they can.There is an alternative, but not an enticing one. The Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons that we'd have to work until 74 to keep a lid on state pension spending.No-one said getting older was easy.",

    "text": "Bank of England: Inside the building that houses 400K gold bars\n\nInside the century-old building standing above 400,000 gold barsBBCThe Bank of England covers a three-and-a-half acre site in the City of LondonThe echoing boom of a slammed door rattles around the walls of the Bank of England's grand columned entrance.Across the floor and walls sprawl grand mosaics and sculptures depicting lions, piles of gold, thunderbolts and ancient Roman gods.\"When this building was created, it was designed as a working bank building. There were people coming and going all day,\" explains the Bank of England Museum's curator, Jenni Adam.\"And immediately they were greeted with this sense of grandeur along with lots and lots of messages about what's happening in this site.\"Bank of England Museum. Photo by Monica A Walker VadilloThe parlours of the first floor have a very different atmosphere to the rooms on the floor belowOne hundred years ago work began to rebuild the Bank of England - a place which had started as a townhouse in the 1700s and expanded over subsequent centuries.To mark this centenary a new exhibition has begun in the bank's museum revealing more about what can be found inside one of Britain's most secure buildings.Ahead of its opening the BBC was given a rare look inside the bank itself, where some of the country's key financial decisions are made and which houses some 400,000 bars of gold in its basement vaults.The Print Collector via Getty ImagesSir John Soane introduced the windowless wall in the 1800s which still surrounds the siteCorbis via Getty ImagesAttempts were made to reproduce the grand banking halls of Soane's bank in the redevelopmentThe bank was first granted a Royal Charter in 1694 when it was \"founded for the use and benefit of the public as a way to manage the national debt and maintain stable finances in Britain\", says Ms Adam.It proved to be a huge success and by 1734 had moved to its current position in Threadneedle Street, with the premises becoming grander and slowly swallowing up surrounding land to cover a three-and-a-half acre (14,000 sq m) site within a windowless wall.Various renowned architects worked on the bank including Sir John Soane in the 1800s, with his building considered one the jewels of the City.However, by the first decades of the 20th Century, Soane's magnificent work was no longer proving fit for purpose.\"By the First World War the staff at the bank had gone from about 1,200 in 1914 to around 4,000 by 1918 and it was clear that there was a real capacity problem,\" says Ms Adam. \"It was doing a colossal job of managing an expensive national debt among many different aspects so it was decided to demolish and rebuild.\"Bank of England MuseumThe bank continued to operate on the site throughout the 14-year project to rebuild itDespite efforts to retain much of its historic character, the 14-year project proved controversial with one architectural expert branding the demolition \"the greatest architectural crime to befall London in the 20th Century\".Even so, upon its completion in 1939 the project led by chief architect Sir Herbert Baker had cost a total of £5m - the equivalent of nearly £285m today - with no expense spared in the creation of the country's central bank.Evidence of such wealth can be seen throughout a development which rises seven floors high and three below.On the ground floor, mosaics by acclaimed Russian artist Boris Anrep spread along a maze of domed grey and black corridors, with figures and sculptures covering the fixtures and fittings throughout.Bank of England MuseumA large mosaic featuring two lions protecting a column of gold stands in the centre of the entrance hall while depictions of the Roman god Mercury are everywhereGolden lions - symbolising security - pop up across the space, from specially designed lighting to staircase bannisters, while even the door handles are miniature recreations of Mercury, the Roman deity of communication and finance. \"There's a real blend of modern and ancient. It gives you the sense that even though this building is relatively new, it's been here forever,\" explains Ms Adam.\"There's a long legacy, a long heritage. You can trust it, it's going to stick around.\"There is also a sign of an even older legacy at the bottom of one long spiralling staircase, where a Roman mosaic that was discovered in the 1930s remains on display.Roman mosaics and numerous other artefacts from the time were found during building workWith grand banking halls based on those from Soane's building hidden off the corridor, occasional echoing thuds and bangs are the main reminder of the working nature of the building.This enterprise also carries on up another set of staircases but in a very different, almost regal atmosphere.One space, the first floor anteroom, is lined with red and gold silk, with centuries-old paintings hanging on the walls and an elaborately decorative fireplace standing beside a huge floor-to-ceiling window.Leading off it are a thick set of wooden double-doors that head into a plush pale blue octagonal room where a portrait of a past governor glares down upon a reproduction of a room created in the 1780s.Without the microphones placed around a curving table and two TV screens, few would consider this somewhere where discussions are held each month that have ramifications for millions of people.\"This is where to the present day, the bank's monetary policy committee meets to make decisions about rates as part of the bank's remit to manage inflation.\"That's why you want the double doors to make sure that nobody is listening into these very important market sensitive conversations,\" Ms Adam explains.Bank of England Museum.

Photo by Monica A Walker VadilloDecisions on the Bank of England's interest rate are made each month in the committee roomThe feel of a grand old building spotted with hints of modernity continues around the floor, with many of the stone elements from the previous bank-like fireplaces and columns reused by Baker.Through another set of double doors is the court room, where a branded lectern stands in front of an 18th Century fireplace beneath an elaborate green ceiling and walls lined with gold.Silhouettes of monarchs from across the lifetime of the bank line the room, while gilded griffins protect piles of gold above the doorways. A wind vane also swings mechanically on one wall recalling a time when London's port was almost on the bank's doorstep and was such a key element of the city's  economy.\"There's just lots of the symbolism of money and finance throughout the space... and gild as far as the eye can see,\" adds the museum curator.The court room is used for activities like large meetings and formal receptionsThe need for tight security means that tours of the building are incredibly rare. The only sight of any of the gold are the two bars held within the museum that are owned by the bank itself.It's why Ms Adam says she's so pleased to be able to put on an exhibition to \"open up the architecture\" and give people an idea of what's inside.\"I've been working in the bank for 15 years and when you come in here every day, it becomes normal,\" she says.\"However, every so often you do go around and think 'this is so spectacular' - and there's just so many stories and details to share.\"Bank of England Museum.

    "text": "Israel has committed genocide in Gaza, UN commission of inquiry says\n\nDavid GrittenLondon andImogen FoulkesGenevaNavi Pillay: \"The committee concluded that Israel has committed genocide against the Palestinian people\"A United Nations commission of inquiry says Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.A new report says there are reasonable grounds to conclude that four of the five genocidal acts defined under international law have been carried out since the start of the war with Hamas in 2023: killing members of a group, causing them serious bodily and mental harm, deliberately inflicting conditions calculated to destroy the group, and preventing births.It cites statements by Israeli leaders, and the pattern of conduct by Israeli forces, as evidence of genocidal intent.Israel's foreign ministry said it categorically rejected the report, denouncing it as \"distorted and false\".The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the unprecedented Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.At least 64,964 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen as reliable by the UN.Most of the population has also been repeatedly displaced; more than 90% of homes are estimated to be damaged or destroyed; the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed; and UN-backed food security experts have declared a famine in Gaza City.ReutersThe mother of a Palestinian teenager killed by Israeli fire mourns during his funeral at a hospital in Gaza City in AugustThe Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory was established by the UN Human Rights Council in 2021 to investigate all alleged violations of international humanitarian and human rights law.The three-member expert panel is chaired by Navi Pillay, a South African former UN human rights chief who was president of the international tribunal on Rwanda's genocide. The two other members are Chris Sidoti, an Australian human rights lawyer, and Miloon Kothari, an Indian expert on housing and land rights.The commission has previously concluded that Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups committed war crimes and other grave violations of international law on 7 October 2023, and that Israeli security forces have committed crimes against humanity and war crimes in Gaza.Jeremy Bowen: UN report a blunt indictment of Israel's actions in GazaLatest updates: Israel launches major ground offensive in Gaza City'The bombing has been insane': Gaza City Palestinians scramble to fleeIsrael committing genocide in Gaza, world's leading experts sayIsraeli rights groups accuse Israel of genocide in GazaThe commission said its latest report was \"the strongest and most authoritative UN finding to date\" on the war. However, it does not officially speak for the UN.The 72-page document alleges that Israeli authorities and Israeli security forces have committed and are continuing to commit four of the five acts of genocide defined under the 1948 Genocide Convention against a national, ethnic, racial or religious group - in this case, Palestinians in Gaza:Killing members of the group through attacks on protected objects; targeting civilians and other protected persons; and the deliberate infliction of conditions causing deathsCausing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group through direct attacks on civilians and protected objects; severe mistreatment of detainees; forced displacement; and environmental destructionDeliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the destruction of the group in whole or in part through destruction of structures and land essential to Palestinians; destruction and denial of access to medical services; forced displacement; blocking essential aid, water, electricity and fuel from reaching Palestinians; reproductive violence; and specific conditions impacting childrenImposing measures intended to prevent births through the December 2023 attack on Gaza's largest fertility clinic, reportedly destroying around 4,000 embryos and 1,000 sperm samples and unfertilised eggsTo fulfil the legal definition of genocide under the Genocide Convention, it must also be established that the perpetrator committed any one of those acts with specific intent to destroy the group in whole or in part.'We went to the facts first,\" Pillay told the BBC. \"So we looked at statements made by the Israeli authorities indicating genocidal intent. And we looked at the pattern of conduct of Israeli authorities and Israeli security forces to show that genocidal intent was the only reasonable inference.\"Israel's political and military leaders have consistently said its military's operations in Gaza are conducted in self-defence, to defeat Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups, and to secure the release of Israeli hostages.They have also insisted that Israeli forces operate in accordance with international law and take all feasible measures to mitigate harm to civilians.However, the commission's report concludes that President Isaac Herzog, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant have \"incited the commission of genocide\" in their speeches and statements.\"As early as 7 October 2023, Prime Minister Netanyahu vowed to inflict… 'mighty vengeance' on 'all of the places where Hamas is deployed, hiding and operating in, that wicked city, we will turn them into rubble',\" Pillay said.\"His use of the phrase 'wicked city' in the same statement implied that he saw the whole city of Gaza [Gaza City] as responsible and a target for vengeance. And he told Palestinians to 'leave now because we will operate forcefully everywhere'.\"Gallant said days after 7 October 2023 that Israel was \"fighting human animals, and we act accordingly\". Herzog meanwhile stated that \"it's an entire nation out there that is responsible\" for the Hamas-led attack.ReutersThe Israeli military has ordered hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to evacuate Gaza City ahead a ground offensive to conquer itThe commission also says \"genocidal intent was the only reasonable inference\" that could be concluded from the pattern of conduct of Israeli authorities and security forces in Gaza.That has allegedly included intentionally killing and seriously harming an unprecedented number of Palestinians using heavy munitions; systematic and widespread attacks on religious, cultural and education sites; imposing a siege on Gaza and starving its population.Pillay added: \"It took us two years to gather all the actions and make factual findings, verify whether that had happened... It's only the facts that will direct you. And you can only bring it under the Genocide Convention if those acts were done with this intention.\"The commission says the acts of Israeli political and military leaders are \"attributable to the State of Israel\", and that the state therefore \"bears responsibility for the failure to prevent genocide, the commission of genocide and the failure to punish genocide\".It also warns all other countries have an immediate obligation under the Genocide Convention to \"prevent and punish the crime of genocide\", employing all measures at their disposal. If they do not, it says, they could be complicit.In a statement, the Israeli foreign ministry accused the three members of the commission of serving as \"Hamas proxies\".\"The report relies entirely on Hamas falsehoods, laundered and repeated by others. These fabrications have already been thoroughly debunked,\" it said.\"In stark contrast to the lies in the report, Hamas is the party that attempted genocide in Israel - murdering 1,200 people, raping women, burning families alive, and openly declaring its goal of killing every Jew.\"An Israeli military official dismissed the report as \"baseless\", saying: \"No other country has operated in these conditions and done so much to prevent harm to civilians on the battlefield.\"President Herzog also condemned the report, which he said had misinterpreted his words, according to Reuters news agency.Daniel Meron, Israel's ambassador to the UN, says Israel \"categorically rejects the libellous rant\"The Israeli foreign ministry also said that the commission's members should not be replaced when they step down from their roles later this year, and that the commission itself should instead be abolished.In July, all three members submitted their resignations to the UN Human Rights Council. Pillay, who is 83, cited her \"age, medical issues and the weight of several other commitments\", while Sidoti said her retirement marked \"an appropriate time to reconstitute the commission\".A number of international and Israeli human rights organisations, independent UN experts, and scholars have also accused Israel of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.The UN says it cannot make a legal determination as to whether a situation constitutes genocide under international law. It says a situation is referred to as genocide only after a competent national or international court has declared it as such.When asked by journalists on Tuesday if he would consider using the word genocide to describe Israel's actions in Gaza, UN human rights chief Volker Türk said: \"It's for the court to decide whether it's genocide or not, and we see the evidence mounting.\"A spokesman for the UK government also said the decision was up to a court, but added that this \"does not take away from our position that Israel's actions are appalling\".The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is currently hearing a case brought by South Africa that accuses Israeli forces of genocide, but it could take years to reach a conclusion. Israel has called the case \"wholly unfounded\" and based on \"biased and false claims\".",

    "text": "JLR could face disruption until November, claim sources\n\nTheo LeggettBusiness correspondentJaguar Land Rover (JLR) has told suppliers that production at its factories will not resume until 24 September at the earliest following a serious cyber attack, but industry sources have warned disruption could last into November.The hack, which occurred more than two weeks ago, forced JLR to shut down its IT networks and paralysed production. A criminal investigation is under way.JLR has dismissed reports that the operational impact of the attack may continue for weeks or months as \"speculation\".But concerns are growing about the impact of the stoppage on the carmaker's extensive supply chain, amid claims some companies could face bankruptcy without prompt financial support.The shutdown is believed to be costing the company at least £50m a week in lost production. JLR would normally expect to build more than 1,000 cars a day.The firm, which is owned by India's Tata Motors, has car plants in Solihull and Halewood, as well as an engine facility in Wolverhampton.It also has large factories in Slovakia and China, as well as a smaller facility in India. But all of the production lines have been at a standstill since 1 September when the hack first came to light.Announcing the latest delay, JLR said: \"We have taken this decision as our forensic investigation of the cyber incident continues and as we consider the different stages of the controlled restart of our global operations, which will take time.\"We are very sorry for the continued disruption this incident is causing and we will continue to update as the investigation progresses.\"JLR initially appeared confident that the situation would be resolved quickly. However, it has since become clear that restarting production is not a simple process.The company has admitted some data may have been viewed or stolen by third parties as a result of the cyber attack. By 24 September, three and a half weeks of output will have been lost. Industry insiders say that even once the production lines have restarted, getting back to normal output is likely to take several weeks.Among suppliers, many of whom are small and medium sized businesses, there is growing concern.Several have told the BBC they simply do not have the financial resources to cope with an extended shutdown and industry experts have said bankruptcies are likely, unless some kind of support is provided.Jason Richards, West Midlands regional officer at Unite the union, told the BBC: \"We're already seeing employers having discussions on potential redundancies.  People have to pay rent, they have to pay mortgages and if they're not getting any pay, what are they supposed to do?\"We need to have a supply chain into Jaguar Land Rover. I can't emphasise it enough [because] if they turn the tap on and they're expecting the supply chain to be waiting on the subs bench, they won't be there,\" he added.With hundreds of thousands of people working in the sector, analysts say there is a risk of lasting damage to the country's engineering base.Unite has called for a furlough scheme to be set up, which would use government money to help pay the salaries of people in the sector who are unable to work due to the stoppage.The Commons Business and Trade Committee has also asked the chancellor what plans she has to support vulnerable businesses in the supply chain. JLR itself is understood to have been holding talks with some suppliers about potential support.While a number of suppliers have expressed concern about a lack of information provided to them by JLR, one leading contractor has defended the company.\"We should not forget who is to blame here,\" said David Roberts, chair of Evtec Group.\"All of this is the fault of criminals. JLR is the victim here. We should remember who started this - and it wasn't JLR.\"A group calling itself Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters has claimed responsibility for the hack. It was also behind a number of high-profile attacks on retailers earlier this year, among them Marks & Spencer and Co-op.",

    "text": "State pension likely to rise by 4.7% next year\n\nPritti Mistrybusiness reporter andKevin Peacheycost of living correspondentGetty ImagesPeople drawing their new state pension from April are likely to see a rise of more than £500 a year, latest wages data suggests.Under the \"triple lock\" policy, the state pension goes up each year by either 2.5%, inflation, or average earnings growth - whichever is the highest figure.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed total pay including bonuses for the three months to July was 4.7%, which is likely to be the figure used for the annual increase. Almost 13 million people receive the state pension in the UK and current projections suggest pensioners will pay income tax on it from 2027 for the first time.The latest wage figures from the ONS likely means: The new flat-rate state pension - for those who reached state pension age after April 2016 - is expected to increase to £241.05 a week. That will take it to £12,534.60 a year, a rise of £561.60 compared with now.The old basic state pension - for those who reached state pension age before April 2016 - is expected to go up to £184.75 a week. That will take it to £9,607 a year, a rise of £431.60 compared with now.With inflation forecast to be 4% in September, it is likely Tuesday's average earnings growth figure will be used to set the increase in the state pension for the third year in a row.Sir Steve Webb, partner at pension consultants LCP and former pensions minister, said the standard rate of the new state pension was \"creeping ever closer to the frozen personal tax allowance\", which currently stands at £12,570 and is set to remain at the same level until 2028.The standard personal allowance is the amount of income permitted each year without paying income tax.Sir Steve said that someone with no other income aside from the new state pension is set to be a taxpayer come April 2027.  \"It is already the case that nearly three quarters of all pensioners pay income tax, and the ongoing freeze in tax thresholds coupled with steady rises in the pension will drag more and more into the tax net,\" he added.Linda, a retired hairdresser from Wokingham, told the BBC she was worried her state pension was being pushed towards the tax threshold.\"They're giving it on one hand and it's taken away in the other, so that's not a load of good,\" she said.\"If they could raise the tax threshold it would make a huge difference.\"The pensioner said she would struggle to manage on the state pension if she lived on her own.\"I'm lucky that my husband's got a good pension so we have a fairly reasonable lifestyle but if left alone I don't know what would happen to be honest.\"Linda believes raising the personal allowance threshold will make \"a huge difference\" to her state pension incomeAccording to the ONS, regular wage growth - excluding bonuses - dropped to 4.8% in the three months to July, down from 5% in the previous three months and the lowest since May 2022.Averages earnings growth in the public sector was 5.6% over the same period, while pay increases in the private sector were 4.7%.Liz McKeown, the ONS director of economic statistics, said salary increases remained \"strong by historic standards\" despite it edging down further in cash terms.However, Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG, said earnings growth was \"likely to continue to decline over the coming year\".\"Demand for workers has fallen sharply due to a combination of weaker economic activity and businesses facing higher labour costs. As a result, we expect wage growth to fall below 4% by the end of the year,\" she added.Not all pensioners receive the full state pension because it depends on years of qualifying contributions through the National Insurance system.For many retired people, the state pension is not their only source of income as they will also receive money from workplace or private pensions.The state pension is the second-largest item in the government budget after health spending.The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition designed the triple lock in 2011 to ensure the value of the state pension was not overtaken by the increase in the cost of living or the incomes of working people.But there has been intense debate over the cost of the triple lock and whether it is justified, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves previously pledging that the Labour government would keep it in place until the end of the current parliament.In July, the government's official forecaster said the cost of the triple lock guarantee was set to be three times higher by the end of the decade than was originally anticipated when it began.Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden said the government promised to \"honour\" the triple lock for the \"course of this parliament\". \"It is estimated that will mean a rise in the State Pension of around £1,900 a year by the end of the parliament,\" he said.The latest ONS data also revealed the UK unemployment rate hit at 4.7% in the three months to July, a level not seen since May 202. There was also a 10,000 drop in vacancies over the quarter to August, while the number of payrolled workers fell last month by 8,000. Ms McKeown said the labour market was continuing \"to cool\" with firms telling the ONS there were \"fewer jobs\" available.But the rate of decline \"appears to be slowing\", she said.",

The UK's Ministry of Defence has previously said it is co-operating with the Kenyan investigation into the case, which has caused outrage in the East African nation.The family of Ms Wanjiru, who left behind a young daughter, have long been fighting for justice.They live in Nanyuki, which is close to the British Army Training Unit Kenya (Batuk) - some 200km (125 miles) north of the capital, Nairobi.Ms Wanjiru's niece, Esther Njoki, told the BBC that the warrant was \"a bitter-sweet moment\", noting the extradition process could take time. The prosecution told the court that witnesses currently based in the UK would be made available for the trial, ensuring that it could proceed.The family's UK-based legal representative, Tessa Gregory, said it now called \"upon the British government to do everything in its power to ensure that the accused can be extradited and face trial in Kenya as soon as possible\".",

    "text": "Israel launches major ground offensive on Gaza City, forcing thousands more to flee\n\nAnadolu via Getty ImagesIsrael ramped up air strikes on Gaza City in recent daysIsrael has launched its long-planned major ground offensive on Gaza City, conducting heavy air strikes overnight as troops pushed into the edges of the city. Thousands of Palestinians have been forced to flee down a single coastal road to the centre of the Strip, joining hundreds of thousands who have already fled.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a \"powerful operation\" had been launched against Hamas's \"last major stronghold\" amid sharp criticism from the UK and other countries.The offensive comes as a UN commission of inquiry found that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza.Huge columns of Palestinians were seen streaming towards the south in donkey carts, rickshaws, vehicles strapped high with belongings, and on foot.Large parts of Gaza City were already destroyed in the first stages of the war in 2023, though around a million Palestinians had returned to their homes since then - often among rubble and bombed-out buildings. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) estimates 350,000 people have now fled, though more than half a million remain in the city. All are being asked to flee south to a \"humanitarian zone\" in a coastal part of the Strip. Many Palestinians say they cannot afford to go south, while others say southern and central Gaza are not safe as Israel has carried out air strikes there too. Some say they have attempted to go south but found no space to pitch their tents, so returned. Lina al-Maghrebi, 32, a mother of three from the city's Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood, told the BBC: \"I was forced to sell my jewellery to cover the cost of displacement and a tent.\"\"It took us ten hours to reach Khan Younis, and we paid 3,500 shekels [£735] for the ride. The line of cars and trucks seemed endless.\"Watch: Blasts over Gaza skyline seen from southern IsraelAmjad al-Nawati, 33,  told the BBC the \"ear-splitting\" noise of bombing through the night had scared his disabled brother, Ahmed. \"He kept putting his hand on his ears... and trembling from fear. I had to calm him and tell him we are leaving soon. It was one of the worst nights in his life.\" Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says 59 people were killed and at least 386 injured in the past 24 hours. Three people, it adds, died as a result of famine and malnutrition, including one child.\"Gaza is burning,\" Israel's Defence Minister, Israel Katz, wrote on X, as the offensive began. \"The IDF strikes with an iron fist at the terrorist infrastructure and IDF soldiers are fighting bravely to create the conditions for the release of the hostages and the defeat of Hamas.\"An IDF official said it believed up to 3,000 Hamas combatants remained in the city.The operation has drawn widespread international condemnation, with UN human rights chief Volker Türk describing it as \"totally and utterly unacceptable\".In other reaction:UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper called the offensive \"utterly reckless and appalling\", saying it would \"only bring more bloodshed, kill more innocent civilians and endanger the remaining hostages\"Turkey's foreign ministry said the assault was a new phase in Israel's \"genocide plans\" and warned that it would trigger mass displacementGerman Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said it was \"the completely wrong path\" and called for diplomacy.But US Secretary of State Marco Rubio appeared to offer tacit support for Israel's operation during a joint press conference with Netanyahu on Monday, saying the US preferred a negotiated end to the war, but that \"sometimes when you're dealing with a group of savages like Hamas, that's not possible\". The UN commission of inquiry said its latest report was \"the strongest and most authoritative UN finding to date\" on the war. However, it does not officially speak for the UN.Among its findings are that Israeli security forces perpetrated \"sexual and gender-based violence\", directly targeted children with the intention to kill them, and carried out a \"systemic and widespread attack\" on religious, cultural and education sites in Gaza.Navi Pillay, the chair of the panel that produced the report, said: \"The genocide convention was born out of humanity's darkest chapters.\"\"Today, we witness in real time how the promise of never again is broken and tested in the eyes of the world,\" she added.Israel's foreign ministry said it categorically rejected the report, denouncing it as \"distorted and false\".Israel launched its war in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 64,964 people have been killed by Israel during its campaign since then - almost half of them women and children, according to Gaza's health ministry.With famine having already been declared in the area by a UN-backed body, the UN has warmed an intensification of the offensive will push civilians into \"even deeper catastrophe\".Additional reporting by Rushdi Abualouf and Ethar Shalaby",

    "text": "'African tribe' evicted from Jedburgh wood - but set up new camp just metres away\n\nJames CheyneJedburgh andRachel GrantThe self-styled \"African tribe\" have made their home in the BordersA self-styled \"African tribe\" has been evicted from privately-owned land in the Scottish Borders - only to set up a new camp just metres away.Five sheriff officers entered the makeshift encampment in woodland near Jedburgh at 08:00 while the three members of the self-proclaimed Kingdom of Kubala group were still asleep.The group packed up their belongings and moved them the short distance to a new site in the woodland, on the other side of a wire fence.The \"tribe\" have been living in the wood for several weeks despite formal attempts to remove them from the land.The three members of the group remained in the woodland but moved a few metres from their previous encampmentThe eviction order was issued by Sheriff Peter Paterson last week after the group ignored a previous instruction to leave their encampment.They said they were reclaiming land that was stolen from their ancestors 400 years ago - but the local council said they were breaking the law.The group have a growing online presence, with more than 100,000 followers on TikTok and Facebook, and have received worldwide media attention.Ghanaian Kofi Offeh, 36, and Jean Gasho, 42, who is originally from Zimbabwe, first arrived in the Jedburgh area in the spring.Describing themselves as King Atehehe and Queen Nandi, they set up camp on a hillside above the town in the Scottish Borders.They were joined by \"handmaiden\" Kaura Taylor, from Texas, who calls herself Asnat.The eviction was carried out by sheriff officers, who were supported by four police officers, on Tuesday morning.Shouting could be heard from the woods as they woke them.The officials remained on site for about 90 minutes, by which time the tribe's tents had been dismantled and their possessions packed up.The group then set up a new camp just metres away on the other side a of a wire fence. They would not directly comment when asked by BBC Scotland what had happened.The three previously camped on the left of the wire fence and have now moved a few metres to the rightThe group claimed ancestral rights to land and insisted that the Kingdom of Kubala had been born.Scottish Borders Council initially evicted the trio from the hillside site above Jedburgh in July.But rather than leave the area, they moved about a mile further out of town to a woodland next to an industrial estate.Mr Offeh previously said he was \"not afraid\" of the warrant for their eviction.The land's owners, David and Mary Palmer, successfully applied to the courts for the tribe to be evicted.The camp is located near Jedburgh in the south of ScotlandHowever, Scottish Borders Council said they had failed to comply with an order to leave the land by 17:00 on Monday.Jedburgh councillor Scott Hamilton said last week that the group were breaking the law by taking up residence on someone else's land.He said the landowner had been left with \"no option\" but to seek an order from the sheriff.Mr Hamilton, deputy leader of the council, said it was disappointing - but not surprising - that the group had ignored the ultimatum to leave the site.\"They have rebuffed every opportunity to engage with us,\" he said.\"We can help them, but we won't sit back and let them break the law.\"",

    "text": "Champions League predictions: Liverpool, Real Madrid or Barcelona?\n\nWho will win Champions League? BBC Sport experts make predictionsThe Champions League is back, but who will get their hands on the famous old trophy this season?Holders Paris St-Germain are one of 36 teams who begin the league phase this week, including six English sides - a record number for any country in the competition.Starting on Tuesday, there are a total of 189 games to be played, including the final at Budapest's Puskas Arena next May.We have asked some of BBC Sport's expert pundits, commentators and journalists who they think will lift the trophy in Hungary, as well as who will go furthest out of Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur.They have also picked their surprise package, and the player they are most looking forward to watching.And you can vote for who you think will be the winners below.Don't forget the BBC will again show highlights of the Champions League this season.From 22:00 BST on the Wednesday of Champions League weeks, there will be match-by-match highlights available on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app, plus a special Champions League Match of the Day on BBC One at 22:40.This week there will also be be a highlights show on Thursday on BBC Two at 23:00.Who will win the Champions League?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, This is the 71st edition of Europe's elite club competition and the 34th since it was renamed the Champions League in 1992. Paris St-Germain won last season's tournament - the first to be held using a new expanded format with a 36-team league phaseBBC's chief football writer Phil McNulty: My pick to win it are Liverpool, purely on the basis of the huge strengthening they have carried out this summer. Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak are two high-class players who are Champions League-ready.The vagaries of the new league system last season saw Liverpool meet eventual winners PSG in the last 16, where they lost on penalties at Anfield.If Liverpool reach the knockout phase, which they surely will, then the Anfield factor grows with every game.PSG will be the big danger once again, a superb side who deserve the status as the best team in Europe, while Real Madrid come into every Champions League conversation as potential winners.BBC's senior football correspondent Sami Mokbel: I'm going for Liverpool. Four wins from four in the Premier League and they haven't even nearly hit top gear yet. Oh, and Isak is waiting in the wings. Arne Slot's side are the team to beat.Former Germany midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger: Real are usually the club with the strongest mentality in this competition, but PSG have to be one of the favourites and Liverpool are too, given that they had such a good Premier League season then invested so much in their squad.Those two teams come immediately to mind when I think about who will play in the final, and if I have to pick one to win it then I will go with Liverpool. Their squad depth is excellent, the quality was already there and now they have got Isak up front as well.BBC Radio 5 Live football correspondent John Murray: When a team wins Europe's richest league at a comparative canter then spends the best part of half a billion pounds on new players, while at the same time securing the services of two of the club's greatest servants, it's difficult to tip anyone other than Liverpool.Last season they lost out only narrowly to the eventual winners in a penalty shootout. It would be a tremendous prospect if this season Liverpool and PSG were to make it all the way to the final in Budapest.Match of the Day commentator Steve Wilson: Tipping Real Madrid to win the Champions League is hardly the work of a soothsayer, but you are not likely to be far wrong. I thought Xabi Alonso did some interesting things with his squad in the Club World Cup - and getting Arda Guler more involved can only be a good thing. His progress was held back by the affection everyone at the Bernabeu had for Luka Modric, now he has licence to really spread his wings.The Observer football correspondent Rory Smith: It's been a frankly unacceptable one season since Real Madrid won the trophy the club sees as its birthright, and Alonso's main task as manager is to put that right. Real are never the most coherent team in Europe, but they have more individual talent than anyone, and often that is what matters.Former England captain Steph Houghton: I am backing PSG to win it again. They are a young squad that has experienced winning already, plus they are athletic and forward thinking.Former Scotland winger Pat Nevin: For a change, I went with my head over my heart. I love PSG and the way they play, and the way they have changed the way football is being played now with their attacking attitude. I also love that they love their wingers!Spanish football expert Guillem Balague: I feel PSG have started a new era of success that has to do with using cleverly the predominant model of our times - positional football - mixed with quality, clear leadership and top players in each position. Barcelona will be close, but I'm not sure they will sort out their defensive deficiencies.BBC Champions League analyst Stephen Warnock: I think Barcelona will win it - and I am going with Lamine Yamal to be the tournament's star player.Former Arsenal defender Matt Upson: I have gone for Barcelona, who are a young team that have grown from the experience of their cracking run to the semi-finals last season.They were very unlucky not to make the final, and played brilliantly against Inter Milan - they just got exposed by a really rigid Inter team that had a way of playing and did what it said on the tin. But Barca will have learned from that.The club appears a little bit unstable off the pitch at the moment but on it they have a nice balance of special young talent and know-how - with the likes of Robert Lewandowski to come on and impact games.Media caption, Paris St-Germain trophy parade along the Champs-ElyseesItalian football expert Nicky Bandini: I'll go with Liverpool. Predicting these things at the start is always a bit of guesswork - winning the Champions League comes down to fitness and form in key moments. PSG only took four points from their first five group games last season, then became a juggernaut by the spring.But Liverpool were good enough to have won it last season - PSG needed a shootout to beat them after all - and spent almost half a billion pounds strengthening again. Hugo Ekitike, Wirtz, Isak - these are all players who can decide games when it matters. They also weren't involved in the Club World Cup over the summer. We're already seeing fatigue and injury catch up to some who were, so I think that may be a factor this season.Former Arsenal forward Theo Walcott: I am not just saying this because I am Arsenal, but I do feel that if they had someone like Viktor Gyokeres in the PSG semi-final they lost last season, then they would have won it. When you create danger and put a ball into certain areas, Gyokeres is going to be there. He is that kind of old-school centre-forward that is going to make a difference for them in a lot of games this season. Arsenal are not going to draw as many games in the Premier League, and he is so equipped for the Champions League knockout ties as well.Add that to the personnel that Arsenal already have, and how strong they are defensively, and that's why I am backing them to win it.BBC Champions League analyst Nedum Onuoha: It's tough to bet against Real Madrid. Last year was one of the worst displays we have seen from them in this competition and they still made it to the knockout stage. Alonso has come in with a new structure, and their new signings will make a difference for them.AI and Opta's 'Supercomputer': We also asked AI's opinion on who will win the Champions League, and included the calculations that Opta's 'Supercomputer' came up with too.The AI prediction was generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict the Champions League winners for the 2025-26 season' and it went for Liverpool.Opta's 'Supercomputer' is actually a complex algorithm that uses a model based on betting market odds and the sports analytics company's own 'Power Rankings', which are calculated using past results.It has simulated the 2025-26 competition 10,000 times and makes Liverpool favourites, with a 20.4% chance of winning, followed by Arsenal (16%), PSG (12.1%) and Manchester City and Barcelona (both 8.4%).Disagree with our expert humans or think you know more than any machine? You can make your own prediction and choose from all 36 teams at the bottom of this page.Who will win the 2025-26 Champions League?Liverpool (7)AI, Nicky Bandini,Thomas Hitzlsperger,Phil McNulty, Sami Mokbel,John Murray& Opta's 'Supercomputer'Paris St-Germain (3)Guillem Balague, Steph Houghton& Pat NevinReal Madrid (3)Nedum Onuoha, Rory Smith& Steve WilsonBarcelona (2)Matt Upson & Stephen WarnockArsenal (1)Theo WalcottSource: BBCWhich English club will go furthest?Phil McNulty: See my first answer, although I do think Arsenal and Manchester City have the capability to go deep into the competition as well as Liverpool. The Gunners reached the semi-final last season and have made serious moves this summer, so they will have high hopes.Nicky Bandini: I've picked them to win it, so it has to be Liverpool! But many of the things I said about them could also be argued for Arsenal - a huge investment in an already top-class squad that wasn't so far off last time around. Really, all the English clubs ought to be capable of a deep run, given their resources. Premier League clubs spent more on transfers this summer than those from La Liga, Serie A, Ligue 1 and the Bundesliga combined.Rory Smith: I'll go for Manchester City on the grounds that I think Arsenal will, come April, get distracted by their (eventually successful) pursuit of the Premier League title. I'd expect all six English teams will make the knockout rounds - and two or three to make the semi-finals - but Pep Guardiola will push particularly hard: Europe may well be his best chance of a major trophy.Theo Walcott: I think all six English teams will do well, not just Arsenal. I only maybe look at Newcastle and think they may not have the strength in depth for this competition, but they should still make the knockout stages.Nedum Onuoha: Having six of them in there, who are capable of beating anyone, is going to be interesting. In terms of who will go furthest, I feel like Liverpool, City and Arsenal's chances are pretty similar. So, apologies to my City folk but I went back to last season and which team went the furthest.That was Arsenal - and that semi-final defeat to PSG they felt so disappointed about. With the players they have brought in this summer, they are capable of going one step further and reaching the final this time.Media caption, No better team in competition than Arsenal - Arteta after Champions League exit against PSGSami Mokbel: Liverpool for all the reasons I've already mentioned. But, away from the Merseysiders, Arsenal look well-equipped to go deep into the competition. Their squad is among the strongest in European football.Steve Wilson: I like the look of Chelsea, but obviously Liverpool will strongly fancy their chances.Stephen Warnock: Chelsea are my surprise package, but Liverpool will go the furthest of the Premier League sides.Steph Houghton: I see Liverpool as having the squad depth to be able to compete in all competitions. Their signings have added real quality to an already strong squad.Matt Upson: For similar reasons to why I think Barca will win it, I think Arsenal will do the best of the English teams. The core of their team is still together, they have strengthened their squad and they are also another big European campaign further along. They can use a run like the one they had last season in order to be even more successful.Pat Nevin: I am certain Arsenal have got that depth you need to go far in this competition.Chelsea have got a good chance of improving again but Arsenal, with their squad and especially when they get everyone back fit, will absolutely be able to manage.Guillem Balague: I think Chelsea are creating something special. Remember when their fans were moaning about the team?The hardest thing is to see the bigger picture when you are a fan, but Chelsea have got youth, direction, a fantastic manager, ambition and order - in the same positional football PSG are so good at. Love their journey to the top.Who will be the surprise package?Media caption, A 'new era' of the Champions League - all you need to knowThomas Hitzlsperger: I've got two teams I'd like to mention here.The first is Athletic Bilbao, who are a team I've been watching a lot and a unique club that I really admire. They are back in the Champions League for the first time since 2015 and their manager Ernesto Valverde has done a phenomenal job. They are a solid side, who have made a very good start to the new season.The other team, Bodo/Glimt, have been one of my favourites for years and they have now finally qualified for the Champions League. People probably don't appreciate enough what they have achieved, even though they saw them reach the Europa League semi-finals when they played Tottenham last season. It's one of the best stories in modern football.Juventus and Manchester City both have to go to Norway to play them, in November and January, and they will definitely not be looking forward to those games.Media caption, 'Spurs are afraid and they should be' Bodo fans confident in the ArcticSteve Wilson: I'm not sure a club with their pedigree can be labelled a 'surprise package' exactly, but I have a real soft spot for Juventus, so I want them to do really well.Nicky Bandini: Maybe Galatasaray. They have put together an astonishingly talented squad these last couple of years. I continue to think Victor Osimhen is one of the best number nines on the planet, so upgrading his loan into a permanent move was a coup, then on top of that they added Leroy Sane this summer, as well as Ilkay Gundogan and Wilfried Singo, who has had a solid couple of seasons at Monaco.You could even throw Mauro Icardi into the mix as the cliched 'like a new signing' if he ever gets back to his best after the cruciate ligament injury he suffered last season. There's a lot for manager Okan Buruk to work with.John Murray: How about the Italian champions Napoli as the surprise package? Always difficult to beat in Naples, now with the added nous of Kevin de Bruyne to add to the wily ways of coach Antonio Conte.Steph Houghton: De Bruyne brings class, experience and something special to Napoli. Not many other players have what he has. He has a chance to win it with his new team.Theo Walcott: Bayern Munich will do well but I know I can't class them as a surprise package because they are expecting to win it. I'm going for Napoli, because of what De Bruyne brings to the table. Phil McNulty: The usual suspects will be involved, but any side coached by Conte will be well organised and a formidable opponent, so I will go with Napoli.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Antonio Conte won Serie A for the fifth time as a manager last season - his first success with Napoli after lifting the title three times with Juventus and once with InterSami Mokbel: Under Conte, Napoli have thrived. They won the Serie A title in his first season in charge and have three from three this season. And with De Bruyne in tow...Rory Smith: There are no surprises in European football any more - the big clubs have spent the better part of 30 years killing them off. I think Qarabag will be better than many expect, based on their Europa League form last year, and Galatasaray and Athletic Bilbao might offer a bit of variety in the last 16. But in terms of actually progressing into the latter stages, it has to be Napoli, given the depth of squad Conte has built. Yep, that's right: this year's dark horses are... the champions of Italy.Pat Nevin: They are a pot three team and they have never been to the Champions League semi-final, and I think they can get there... so that makes Napoli a surprise package even though I admit it's a bit of a cheat.Matt Upson: I suppose Napoli are a surprise on this stage - while they are flying in Serie A, if they did well in the Champions League it would probably come as more of shock than if Inter or Juve did, even though Napoli are probably the better team.Nedum Onuoha: This is a bit of a paradox in some ways because they are in pot one, but I think Chelsea are very capable of beating absolutely anyone.They are Club World Cup champions - I know some people want to disregard that title but most people thought that PSG side were unbeatable, so I'll give Chelsea some credit there.Guillem Balague: Watch out for Villarreal. They are solid, have signed players that will have to show their worth, but they have spent more than ever. Marcelino Garcia Toral is one of the top managers in Europe - have a look at his career - and offers physicality, order and quality upfront - the type of qualities that can take them far.Which player are you most looking forward to watching?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Williams scored the opening goal in the Euro 2024 final when Spain beat England 2-1 in BerlinRory Smith: The fact the younger Williams brother, Nico, is still at Athletic Bilbao is down, more than anything, to Barcelona's ongoing financial malaise, but it is the sort of thing that should be celebrated. He signed a 10-year deal this summer, and he will want to prove he can cut it on the biggest club stage. I'd mention Edon Zhegrova at Juventus, too, another edge-of-your-seat winger, but having two is cheating.Guillem Balague: Desire Doue (PSG), Lamine Yamal (Barcelona), Joao Pedro (Chelsea), Tajon Buchanan (Villarreal), Arda Guler and Kylian Mbappe (both Real Madrid)... do I have to chose just the one? This is a competition full of interest and quality. The toughest one to win.Pat Nevin: Estevao Willian has got every chance of being one of the best in the business.Nedum Onuoha: I wanted to go for Estevao but Pat Nevin took him first... so I have gone more defensive minded, and I've picked Dean Huijsen.If Real Madrid are going to win the Champions League this year, it's going to come down to that big defender doing well for them, because a Xabi Alonso team is built on that strong defensive foundation, and I think Huijsen is going to be the star.Theo Walcott: I am really looking forward to seeing Arsenal's Eberechi Eze in the Champions League.It's very different to Premier League football and there might be games where he gets a bit more time on the ball. When you give that time to a player like him, who is so gifted, it is exciting to think what he could do.If I had to pick a player from outside the Premier League then it would have to be Yamal, because I don't see a lot of him. With Eze, I know what he can do and I want him to show everyone on this kind of stage.Phil McNulty: It's not a shock choice but I can't wait to see Yamal play for Barcelona, hopefully starting against Newcastle on Thursday, although the 18-year-old is struggling with a back injury picked up on international duty with Spain.PSG's Doue is another brilliant young talent currently struggling with an injury, but he is another who will light up the tournament when fit, as he did so wonderfully last season.Matt Upson: Yamal is the player I want to see. He is a ridiculous talent and I love watching him play.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Yamal's first goal for Barcelona in the first leg of their semi-final against Inter made him the youngest scorer in a Champions League semi-final - aged 17 years and 291 days - breaking Kylian Mbappe's record of 18 years and 140 days set in 2017John Murray: The player I'm looking forward to watching is Yamal as I am yet to commentate on him in a Barcelona shirt. While disappointingly it looks like he might not be fit for Thursday at St James' Park, I suspect there will be other opportunities as this Champions League progresses.Sami Mokbel: At 18, Yamal is still a kid - but already one of the premier attacking talents in European football. Destined to be one of, if not the, best footballers in the world.Steph Houghton: Yamal is a global superstar. I'm excited to see how he performs against teams that are more than likely going to double up against him.Nicky Bandini: We're all itching to see more of Yamal, aren't we? The two legs of Barcelona's semi-final against Inter last season will stay with me for a very long time. Maybe it's unfair to ask an 18-year-old what he can do for an encore, but you can't help but be excited at the prospect.There are plenty of others I'm excited to watch too though! Of course we're all curious about Max Dowman after he made his debut for Arsenal at 15, and it'll be fun to see Scott McTominay in the Champions League with Napoli after he fired them to a domestic title last season and was named  Serie A's Most Valuable Player. I wonder if this might be a breakout year for Kenan Yildiz too, still only 20 and with a full season of starting for Juventus now under his belt.Media caption, 'The Premier League was quite hard, I had to go off with cramps' - WoltemadeSteve Wilson: Nick Woltemade was left out of Stuttgart's Champions League squad last season, so will presumably make his debut in the competition when Newcastle play Barca on matchday one. Memories of Tino Asprilla, anyone?Thomas Hitzlsperger: It's probably not the most obvious choice, but I am going for Woltemade. There has been so much talk about him for a while - maybe not in England until Newcastle signed him for £69m, but definitely in Germany.Bayern Munich wanted to sign him in the summer but Stuttgart would not sell him for the money they were offering. Bayern president Uli Hoeness says Woltemade is not worth what Newcastle paid for him, but the big price tag is not his fault.Woltemade has just helped Stuttgart win the German Cup and he has got something about him. He seems a very down-to-earth guy who you want to do well and I hope his ability will shine through in the Premier League as well as the Champions League.So, what do you think?Related topicsLiverpoolNapoliBarcelonaParis St-GermainChelseaManchester CityReal MadridTottenham HotspurArsenalUEFA Champions LeagueNewcastle UnitedFootballMore on this story",

    "text": "World Athletics Championships: Faith Kipyegon storms to historic fourth 1500m title in Tokyo\n\nMedia caption, Kipyegon defends World Championship title to take gold for KenyaFaith Kipyegon stormed to a historic fourth world 1500m title as the Kenyan great extended her streak of dominance with a fifth consecutive global gold in the event.The 31-year-old matched retired men's world record holder Hicham El Guerrouj as the only other athlete in history to amass four 1500m titles at the championships.After securing her third consecutive Olympic triumph last year, this was also a third straight world gold for Kipyegon, who controlled the final from the start before bursting clear of her rivals on the final lap.Not only is the world record holder unbeaten in the past five global finals but, excluding heats, she has not suffered defeat over the distance for more than four years.Australia's Olympic silver medallist Jessica Hull faded to bronze after attempting to follow as Kipyegon wound up the pace, with Dorcus Ewoi securing a Kenyan one-two.The unstoppable Kipyegon crossed the line in three minutes 52.15 seconds, the chasm separating her from her competitors evidenced by the near three-second wait for Ewoi to follow.\"I just want to thank God,\" Kipyegon told BBC Sport.\"I knew I was capable of defending my world title after breaking the world record [earlier this year]. I thank God that I was strong today.\"I just wanted to run comfortable without pushes and falls, because I was a little bit scared seeing people falling. I just wanted to be by myself and run my race.\"'There's nothing anyone can do to stop her'With outstretched arms and a relaxed smile which suggested it had never felt in doubt, Kipyegon celebrated the eighth global gold of her career.That is level with Jamaican sprint star Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce - the only other woman to win as many as four world titles in the same event - and distance running great Tirunesh Dibaba for the most by a female athlete in individual events.Kipyegon will now target a second successive world double in the 5,000m, the heats for which begin on Thursday before Saturday's final.She became the first woman to achieve that world 1500m-5,000m double two years ago.The competition in the women's 1500m is fierce, and was a factor in Great Britain's Olympic 1500m bronze medallist Georgia Hunter Bell's decision to prioritise the 800m in Japan.Yet it has been a long time since the destination of the gold medal was in doubt.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Faith Kipyegon has won eight global golds on the trackKipyegon has swept seven of the past eight global titles, with Sifan Hassan the last athlete to deny her at the 2019 World Championships in Doha.Keen to continue pushing the boundaries - and, as a mother, inspire young girls and women in particular - she made an ambitious bid to become the first woman in history to run a sub-four-minute mile in June.Although she came up short, she still ran 1.22 seconds faster than her personal best of 4:07.64 - the time which remains the official mile world record, and still five seconds faster than any other woman has run in history.Long before she was pursuing history in the latest high-tech shoes, Kipyegon would run barefoot to and from school in her village as a child. She even won her first global cross country title with nothing on her feet.The oldest woman to ever win a world 1500m title, she continues to go from strength to strength.Kipyegon began the year by just missing the world 1000m record in April, improved her 1500m world record to 3:48.68 in July, and was within a second of breaking the 3,000m record - which has stood for 32 years - in her final race before Tokyo.One night after Armand Duplantis soared to a 14th world record and third world title at Japan's National Stadium, this too appears a reign of dominance unlikely to end any time soon.Commentating on BBC TV, Andrew Cotter said: \"I like the way she goes about this type of race. She can do a 58 last lap, the others can't. \"She makes the third lap quicker than the second, the second quicker than the first. \"It just means that there is nothing anyone else can do but survive, hang on.\"More on this story",

    "text": "Mykhailo Mudryk: Doping case status and whereabouts of Chelsea and Ukraine winger explained\n\nLawyers, losses and lie detectors - inside Mudryk doping caseImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Mykhailo Mudryk has not played for Chelsea in almost a year and was formally charged by the FA in JuneMykhailo Mudryk is currently suspended and unable to play for either Chelsea or Ukraine after being charged with a doping offence by the Football Association - but what is going on behind the scenes?The 24-year-old winger joined Chelsea for an initial €70m (£61m) in January 2023 and has made 73 appearances for the club.He was provisionally suspended in December 2024 after a urine test provided a positive result for a banned substance, and was formally charged in June.The FA investigation is ongoing and the outcome, its timing, and any potential punishment all remain unclear. There is no defined time frame for doping cases - they last as long as it takes to sift through all the evidence.Mudryk's legal defence is being managed by Morgan Sports Law, the firm who worked with former Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba during his doping case while playing for Juventus, as well as boxer Tyson Fury and cyclist Chris Froome during their respective investigations.BBC Sport has taken an in-depth look at Mudryk's situation, talking to people in both Ukraine and London to find out where he is and what is going on.How did Mudryk's positive doping test result come about?After news of his positive test was made public, Mudryk wrote on Instagram: \"This has come as a complete shock as I have never knowingly used any banned substances or broken any rules, and am working closely with my team to investigate how this could have happened. \"I know that I have not done anything wrong and remain hopeful that I will be back on the pitch soon.\"Mudryk's legal team and those in his tight-knit circle insist he did not knowingly ingest any banned substance, and multiple sources claim he has passed an unverified lie detector test attesting to that.The BBC has learned that Mudryk came into contact with the cardiovascular medication meldonium, which has the potential to increase respiratory capacity and stamina, while on duty with the Ukraine national team. When asked to verify this, the Ukrainian Football Association (UAF) did not issue a denial, but insisted none of their staff members were involved.\"UAF officials cannot comment on this matter, since the UAF is not a part of this case,\" it told BBC Sport. \"The World Anti-Doping Energy (Wada) or the English FA didn't send any request to the UAF.\"We are in close contact with Mudryk's lawyers and provide them with all necessary information. We cannot comment further, as a non-disclosure provision is in effect.\"No UAF official, staff, doctors, or coach were involved.\"UAF president and former Chelsea striker Andriy Shevchenko has not visited him at any point, although he also maintains a residence in London.It remains unclear how exactly Mudryk apparently ingested meldonium, which has been banned by Wada since 2016 and is primarily used in Eastern European countries to treat conditions such as angina, heart failure, and coronary artery disease.Tests at the 2015 European Games in Baku found that 13 medallists were taking the substance at the time, and that its use occurred in the majority of the sports included in the Games.Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova failed a drugs test in March 2016 after meldonium was detected in her sample.What is the feeling about Mudryk's case in Ukraine?During the most recent international break, Ukraine's national team lost at home to France and drew away with Azerbaijan, meaning they risk missing out on qualification for the World Cup in 2026. Therefore, the absence of Mudryk has led to frustration and intrigue in the country.His former club Shakhtar Donetsk stand to lose a potential €30m (£26m) in add-ons, which were agreed by Chelsea in addition to the upfront transfer fee.The conditions for those fees are likely to never be fulfilled with Mudryk unable to play, but reports in Ukraine suggesting Shakhtar are considering suing the UAF over the potential lost earnings were described as \"nonsense\" by the club's CEO Sergei Palkin, and the club insists finances are not its primary concern.\"When we speak about Mudryk, we don't think about the money, we speak about the human being,\" the club's sporting director Dario Srna told BBC Sport. \"We feel so sorry for him. We know he is 100% innocent - he will show that.  \"We support him like an ex-player, a human being and a friend. We don't think the money is important.\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Mudryk became one of Europe's most highly rated young players during his time with ShakhtarShakhtar CEO Palkin added: \"From time to time, I've spoken with Mudryk on the phone, and we've even met a couple of times in London. We maintain contact because he is our academy graduate and a high-profile player. \"Our relationship has always been good, and I felt it was important to support him morally during this period.\"Palkin said he had \"no idea\" how the positive test happened.\"Based on the information available to me, I simply cannot understand the circumstances that led to it,\" he said.\"I have been in contact with the UAF. I asked them to support Mudryk and requested that the lawyers handling this case respond responsibly and without delay.\"This situation affects the image of Ukraine and Ukrainian football as a whole. That's why, if there is any opportunity to help him, we must do so.\"I don't know where that information [about potentially suing the UAF] came from. It's nonsense. This idea has no basis whatsoever.\"I remain hopeful that this process with Mudryk will be resolved as quickly as possible, and that he will return to the pitch to continue his career.\"Where is Mudryk and what is he doing?Mudryk last made a public appearance after Chelsea's 4-1 Uefa Conference League final win over Real Betis, which he watched in a private capacity. The 24-year-old met supporters when out walking with friends in the Polish city of Wroclaw and attended Chelsea's celebration party at the team's hotel. Since then Mudryk has remained in London, though he is unable to play matches or even train alongside his team-mates. A devout Orthodox Christian, he frequently attends church and those around him insist he is in good physical and mental health.The Ukrainian is training alone with a private coach at private facilities, and his camp is confident he is doing all he can from a fitness perspective to minimise any damage to his career. Chelsea are tracking his progress but the terms of his suspension mean he is extremely limited in the access he is allowed to the club, its facilities and his team-mates.Mudryk last played for Chelsea on 28 November 2024 and was an unused substitute for a league match three days later against Aston Villa.The club are expected to wait until the outcome of the case before commenting. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Mudryk had been an important player for Ukraine prior to his suspension, having played 28 times since making his debut in 2022What happens next?If Mudryk is deemed to have broken the rules, he faces of a ban of up to four years.The FA treats all doping cases confidentially - that means there is no information available about where there case is up to, or what the outcome might be.Mudryk and his legal team could potentially mount an appeal - which would be assessed by the FA's anti-doping tribunal - if he is found guilty.There is also the possibility of a further appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland after that.In Pogba's case, 18 months passed between his initial positive test and the date he was permitted to return to playing football after his ban was reduced on appeal.So whether or not he is found guilty, fans can still expect to wait a fair while before Mudryk takes to the field for any team.More on this story",

We are very happy Thomas is with us for his football capacity, football ability and his presence as a human.\"\"He is a great player with a lot of experience. He has played for a lot of top clubs. We know he has a great level.\"When Marcelino was asked if he had spoken to Partey about the hostility he could face from Tottenham fans, the Spaniard said he was focusing on the football.\"We're interpreting stuff about and talking about a player that could be totally innocent,\" said Marcelino.\"We're playing a game of football tomorrow where the important thing is football. \"This is where football was invented after all. Do you understand me? Thank you.\"Partey joined Arsenal from Atletico Madrid in 2020 and played 167 times for the club, scoring nine goals.He has played four times for Villarreal this season, making one start.",
